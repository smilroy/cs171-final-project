The Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013), coordinated by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), estimated the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors globally and for 21 regions.

The sixth Millennium Development Goal (MDG 6) brought special attention to HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. This dataset provides estimates of mortality and prevalence for each of the three diseases, as well as incidence of HIV and tuberculosis, for 188 countries, 21 regions, and globally by age group and sex, for 1990-2013. The results were published in The Lancet in July 2014 in "Global, regional, and national incidence and mortality for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria during 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013."
