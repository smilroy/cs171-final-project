# Mortality Data Sources & Information

The GBD Study 2010 estimated the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors globally and for 21 regions for 1990 and 2010. The study was implemented as a collaboration of Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) as coordinating center, University of Queensland, Harvard School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, University of Tokyo, Imperial College London, and WHO.

One dataset provides number of deaths and mortality rates for 187 countries, 21 regions, and globally by age group and sex, for 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2010. The other provides the probabilities of dying between the ages of 15 and 60 (45q15), the probabilities of dying between birth and age 5 (5q0), and mean ages of death for the same geographies and years, and by sex. The results were published in The Lancet in December 2012 in "Age-specific and sex-specific mortality in 187 countries, 1970-2010: a systematic analysis for the GBD Study 2010."

The GBD Study 2010 estimated the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors globally and for 21 regions for 1990 and 2010. The study was implemented as a collaboration of Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) as coordinating center, University of Queensland, Harvard School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, University of Tokyo, Imperial College London, and WHO.

This dataset provides four metrics with uncertainty intervals for 291 diseases and injuries: deaths, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by region, age, and sex. The results were published in The Lancet in December 2012 in "Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups," "Years lived with disability (YLDs) for 1160 sequelae of 289 diseases and injuries 1990-2010," and "Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 291 diseases and injuries in 21 regions, 1990-2010."

The Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013), coordinated by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), estimated the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors globally and for 21 regions. The files available for download include the tables published in The Lancet in December 2014 in "Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013." These tables include estimates of mortality rates and numbers, and years of life lost (YLLs) globally by age, sex, and cause. Also included is a mean life table for 1990-2013 with age-specific mortality rates and life expectancy. GBD 2010 DisMod source code for estimation and the source code for the updated GBD 2013 methods are both available online.
