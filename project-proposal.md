Project Proposal
===

### Background and Motivation. 

Discuss your motivations and reasons for choosing this project, especially any background or research interests that may have influenced your decision.

### Project Objectives. 

Provide the primary questions you are trying to answer with your visualization. What would you like to learn and accomplish? List the benefits.

### Data. 

From where and how are you collecting your data? If appropriate, provide a link to your data sources.

### Data Processing. 

Do you expect to do substantial data cleanup? What quantities do you plan to derive from your data? How will data processing be implemented?

### Visualization. 

How will you display your data? Provide some general ideas that you have for the visualization design. Include sketches of your design.

### Must-Have Features. 

These are features without which you would consider your project to be a failure.

[Work In Progress]

1. Adolescent AIDS prevalence rate for a given year on a global map
2. Adolescent AIDS death rate for a given year on a global map
3. Must show total number on selecting a particular country
4. Must have a comparative visualization showing % rate difference between global population vs adolescent population
5. Must have a comparative visualization showing % rate difference between male and female adolescents
6. Visualization must have a way to toggle between prevalence and death data
7. All the visualizations must be updated to reflect the correct data when user toggles a selection
8. Must have a time slider for users to choose year for which they want to see the data
9. Trend analysis visualization to show the trend for all the countries over the years
10. Must have a filtering mechanism in trend visualization to allow users to filter by country


### Optional Features. 

[Work In Progress]

1. Make trend svg lines clickable to show country specific data
2. Show co-relation between gdp and adolescent aids
3. 

Those features which you consider would be nice to have, but not critical.

### Project Schedule. 

Make sure that you plan your work so that you can avoid a big rush right before the final project deadline, and delegate different modules and responsibilities among your team members. Write this in terms of weekly deadlines.
